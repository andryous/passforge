# PassForge API ðŸš€

A powerful and educational REST API built with Java and Spring Boot to analyze password strength and check for data breaches.

## About This Project

This project is a personal learning initiative to build a robust backend application from the ground up. The primary goals were to practice professional development workflows, understand layered architecture, and implement a scalable, rule-based logic engine.

---

## Core Features

* **Rule-Based Strength Analysis:** Password strength is calculated via a dynamic and scalable engine. New rules (e.g., for length, character variety, common passwords) can be easily added.
* **Data Breach Checking:** Integrates with the "Have I Been Pwned" (HIBP) API using the secure k-Anonymity model to check if a password has been exposed in a known data breach.
* **Actionable Suggestions:** Provides a list of concrete suggestions to help users improve their password security.
* **Unit Tested:** Core business logic is verified with JUnit 5 tests to ensure reliability.

## API Endpoints

### Analyze Password

Analyzes a given password for strength and breach status.

* **URL:** `/api/passwords/analyze`
* **Method:** `POST`
* **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
        "password": "your_password_here"
    }
    ```

* **Success Response (200 OK):**

    ```json
    {
        "score": 70,
        "strengthLevel": "STRONG",
        "pwned": false,
        "suggestions": [
            "Consider making your password longer than 12 characters."
        ]
    }
    ```
